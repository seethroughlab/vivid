[x] I don't want "Vivid V3" in all of the headers. This isn't *really* v3 -- it's just that I had 2 false start. So really, this is vivid 0.1.0.
[x] the noise operator should support many versions of noise: perlin, simplex, etc.
[x] Add to the chain-demo: a noise node DISTORTS a texture loaded from assets/images
[x] The title bar should include the name of the project
[x] The 'f' key should toggle fullscreen 
[x] I don't like the extern "C" stuff in the chain.cpp files. It seems like boilerplate. In vivid_v1 we just had a VIVID_CHAIN(setup, update) macro. Is it possible to use that approach here?
[x] Create a README.md that follows the conventions of READMEs on github
[x] Add reminders to the ROADMAP to update the readme at the end of major phases.
[ ] PLAN: we just finished phase 4 and 5. what kind of examples would best illustrate everyting we added? 
[x] It seems that, in the jump to v3, we lost some of the emphasis on vivid bring LLM-first in the documentation. Let's update the README and the ROADMAP so that they reflect that one of the core philosophies of the project is to be LLM-friendly. It's already mentioned in docs/PHILOSOPHY.md in the "LLM-Native Workflow" section.
