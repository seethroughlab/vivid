[x] I don't want "Vivid V3" in all of the headers. This isn't *really* v3 -- it's just that I had 2 false start. So really, this is vivid 0.1.0.
[x] the noise operator should support many versions of noise: perlin, simplex, etc.
[x] Add to the chain-demo: a noise node DISTORTS a texture loaded from assets/images
[x] The title bar should include the name of the project
[x] The 'f' key should toggle fullscreen 
[x] I don't like the extern "C" stuff in the chain.cpp files. It seems like boilerplate. In vivid_v1 we just had a VIVID_CHAIN(setup, update) macro. Is it possible to use that approach here?
[ ] Create a README.md that follows the conventions of READMEs on github
