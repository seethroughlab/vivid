Before we proceed: The first thing I asked you to do was to explore vivid_v1 and vivid_v2 to understand the general approach, how I hit a dead end, and why I decided to start over. Please add a section to the top of the ROADMAP.md that explains these two failed attempts, and the lessons that we should take moving forward. I'd like to remove vivid_v1 and vivid_v2 from the project, so you should include anything that will be useful about these old versions so that I don't have to ask you to explore the projects every someone explores the project.
