# Hello Noise Example
# This is just for reference - chains are hot-reloaded, not statically compiled

# Note: This CMakeLists.txt isn't actually used during normal operation.
# It's here for documentation and potential static build support.
# The chain.cpp is dynamically compiled by vivid's hot-reload system.
