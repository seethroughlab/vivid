Aesthetic Description

The Wipeout 2097 aesthetic is defined by retro-futuristic minimalism: fast, aerodynamic anti-gravity craft built from clean low-poly forms, bold graphic silhouettes, and flat, brightly-colored textures that feel like early PlayStation-era art but with elegant industrial design. Surfaces are smooth and simplified rather than mechanically detailed; the illusion of complexity comes from color blocking, decals, and sharp contrast rather than geometry. The world feels like a frictionless, high-speed visual language—sleek curves reduced to faceted polygons, hand-painted shading, and tight palettes that pop even under simple lighting.

For a procedural generator, the style is less about photorealism and more about controlled abstraction. You want clean polygonal geometry, deliberate faceting, UV-friendly shapes, simple material definitions, and a rendering pipeline that embraces imperfections: low-resolution textures, vertex-lit shading, dithering, and perspective distortions that mimic early 3D hardware. The result should feel fast, graphic, and slightly imperfect—evoking the PS1 era without directly imitating it.

# Rendering Techniques & Procedural Modeling Details

## Geometry & Procedural Modeling

- Low-poly construction: Limit segments on curves; build wings and fuselage using faceted polygons instead of smoothed normals.
- Chunky silhouette logic: Procedurally generate wide side-pods, slim fuselages, and strong top-view shapes.
- Symmetry tooling: Procedural mirroring along the X-axis ensures classic anti-grav racer balance.
- Modular “pod/fin” library: Procedurally attach winglets, spoilers, and vents as low-poly prefabs.
- Avoid micro-details: Keep features large enough to be represented by a handful of quads.
- Vertex coloring: Use baked vertex colors to reinforce stylized shading.

## Texture & Material Style

- Single diffuse texture per craft (e.g., 256×256):
- Procedurally generate color blocks, racing stripes, decals, numeric IDs, sponsor graphics.
- Avoid normal, roughness, or metallic maps entirely.
- Palette control: Limit to 8–16 key colors with high contrast.
- UV unwrap simplification: Use large, contiguous UV islands to mimic hand-painted PS1 mapping.
- Procedural decal placement: Stickers, arrows, hazard stripes generated at random but symmetrical positions.

## Shading & Lighting

- Vertex-lit shading (no PBR): Emulate early fixed-function pipelines.
- Flat shading option: Per-face normals for crisp, faceted lighting.
- Toon ramp or step-shading: 2–3-step diffuse ramps to give a painted, graphic look.
- Specular as a simple white highlight: Small, hard specular spots with no BRDF.
- No environment maps: Keep reflections minimal or nonexistent.

## Post-processing & Retro Effects

- Dithering (Bayer, blue-noise, or ordered):
- Apply to shading, shadows, and gradients to recreate early GPU limitations.
- Affine texture warping simulation: Mild UV wobble dependent on screen space, imitating PS1 affine inaccuracies.
- Low-resolution render buffer: e.g., render at 480p → upscale with nearest-neighbor filtering.
- Vignetting + subtle chromatic fringing for a CRT-era “speed” look.
- Optional motion streaks: Procedurally generated mesh trails or screen-space streaks to emphasize velocity.

Camera & Motion

- Aggressive FOV (70–90°) to exaggerate speed.
- Camera shake depending on thrust: Simple noise-based offsets.
- Motion blur simulation (if desired): Fake with streak sprites, not full TAA blur.

Procedural Craft Variation

- Parametric hull curves: Sweep or loft shapes along Bézier curves with quantized segments.
- Randomized wing sweep angles, pod thickness, cockpit shape.
- Symmetrical decal generation synced to UV layout.
- LOD system that intentionally ends at low resolution, not high.
