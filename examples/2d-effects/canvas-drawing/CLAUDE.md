# Canvas Drawing

Demonstrates the HTML5 Canvas-style 2D drawing API with shapes, paths, gradients, transforms, and clipping.

## Vision

A comprehensive showcase of Vivid's Canvas operator, modeled after the familiar HTML5 Canvas 2D context. Animated shapes demonstrate the full range of drawing capabilities.

## Features

- **Basic shapes**: fillRect, fillCircle, strokeCircle
- **Path API**: beginPath, moveTo, lineTo, arc, quadraticCurveTo, closePath
- **Gradients**: linear and radial gradients with color stops
- **Transforms**: save/restore, translate, rotate
- **Clipping**: circular clip regions with clip()
- **Styling**: fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth

## Animation

- Bouncing ball with trigonometric motion
- Rotating squares orbiting the center
- Pulsing ring with strokeCircle
- Radiating lines from center
- Spinning star using transforms
- Slow HSV hue cycling on the entire output
