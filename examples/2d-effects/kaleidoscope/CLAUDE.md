# Kaleidoscope

Animated kaleidoscope effect combining noise, mirroring, and post-processing for a hypnotic visual experience.

## Vision

A flowing, symmetrical pattern that evokes looking through a kaleidoscope. Fractal noise is reflected and rotated into perfect symmetry, then enhanced with bloom and chromatic aberration for an optical, glass-like quality.

## Operators

| Operator | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Noise | Source pattern (simplex, 4 octaves) |
| Transform | Rotation and scale animation |
| Mirror | Kaleidoscope mode with 8 segments |
| HSV | Hue shifting for color cycling |
| Bloom | Soft glow on bright areas |
| ChromaticAberration | Radial color fringing |

## Interaction

- **Mouse X** - Hue shift (0-1)
- **Mouse Y** - Bloom intensity (0.2-1.0)
- **Keys 3-9, 0** - Change segment count (3-12)

## Animation

- Noise offset drifts for flowing pattern
- Transform rotates and pulses scale
- Mirror angle slowly rotates
- Continuous hue cycling over time
