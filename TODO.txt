- Do we need to change anything to get this to work on Windows? 
- How do I install the VS Code extension locally? And how do I upload it to make it generally available?
- One thing that I DON'T like about TD is that you can't really instantiatye anything. Lots of the advantages of OOP are lost in TD because you can't create objects. I want to make sure the long-term plan for Vivid is still firmly in the C++ world, even though TD is the inspiration. What can we add to the PLAN to ensure that happens?
- Vsync?
- Let's make a plan for different lighting and shading methods, like phong, PBR, etc. and add it to the PLAN and CHECKLIST documents. 
- In TD there is an idea of a Camera that you can position.
