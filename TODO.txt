== HIGHEST PRIORITY ==
- Implement Chain API (Phase 0 in CHECKLIST.md)
  - Declarative operator composition: setup(Chain&) / update(Chain&, Context&)
  - Operator registry with VIVID_REGISTER_OPERATOR macro
  - Dependency resolution from .input() calls
  - Hot-reload with state preservation
  - Migrate all examples to new API

== QUESTIONS / FUTURE ==
- Do we need to change anything to get this to work on Windows?
- How do I install the VS Code extension locally? And how do I upload it to make it generally available?
- One thing that I DON'T like about TD is that you can't really instantiatye anything. Lots of the advantages of OOP are lost in TD because you can't create objects. I want to make sure the long-term plan for Vivid is still firmly in the C++ world, even though TD is the inspiration. What can we add to the PLAN to ensure that happens?
- How can we add a system where users (community) can make new nodes? I'm thinking about a kind of registry like pip or npm. This is a big project but I want to lay the groundwork for it now.
- One of my favorite things in TD is a video (file or webcam) feeding into a 3D Texture operator that cahces frames, and then a TimeMachine operator where you can use a grayscale operator to choose some frame from the cache for a particular part of the image. 
- please add more examples to 14.1 Core Feature Examples -- I'm thinking specifically of mouse input and spout/syphon, but I'd also like examples of other core functionality (both current and future)
